Why do we need super(props)?
    This thing basically allows accessing this.props in a Constructor function. 
    In fact, what the super() function does is, calls the constructor of the parent class. 

Why async wont work with useEffect
    Because React’s useEffect hook expects a cleanup function returned from it which is called when the component unmounts.
    Using an async function here will cause a bug as the cleanup function will never get called. Yikes! 

Code splittiing - lazy loading

Suspense
    Suspense lets components “wait” for something before rendering.
    Today, Suspense only supports one use case: loading components dynamically with React.lazy.
