Context.Provider
    <MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
    Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
    The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider.
    One Provider can be connected to many consumers. Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree.

MyContext.Consumer
    <MyContext.Consumer>
        {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
    </MyContext.Consumer>
    A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within
    a function component.
    Requires a function as a child. The function receives the current context value and returns a React node.
    The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above
    in the tree. If there is no Provider for this context above, the value argument will be equal to the defaultValue
    that was passed to createContext().
