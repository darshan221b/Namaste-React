What is React.Fragment or <></>
    A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

What is the Virtual DOM?
    The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, 
    representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
    This process is called reconciliation.

What is “React Fiber”?
    Fiber is the new reconciliation engine in React 16. Its main goal is to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM.
